This folder contains exercises called "APTs", or Algorithmic Problem-Solving and Testing problems, completed in Java over the course of a class in data structures and algorithms. As a note, these problems were written to help students think about algorithms and data structures in new ways. These solutions are written for the purpose of learning, and sometimes were written under time pressure; thus, they are optimized simply to solve the problem at hand and not for efficiency.
